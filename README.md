# Portfolio: Graduate Projects (MSc)

## 🎓 Collection Overview

This repository houses advanced projects developed during my **Master of Science** studies. These works focus on specialized domains such as **Blockchain Engineering** and **Machine Learning**.

## 📂 Highlights

- **Blockchain Protocols**: In-depth analysis and implementation of consensus mechanisms (Bitcoin) and smart contracts (Ethereum).
- **Machine Learning**: Advanced assignments covering neural networks, regression, and classification tasks details in `Machine Learning Assigments`.
- **Academic Reports**: Detailed PDF reports on blockchain architectures (`Assignment 1 2021 - Bitcoin.pdf`, `Assignment 2 2021 - Ethereum.pdf`).

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Blockchain**: Bitcoin Script, Solidity, Ethereum EVM
- **AI/ML**: Python (PyTorch/TensorFlow), Data Analysis
- **Documentation**: LaTeX / Academic Writing

## 💡 Innovation

Unlike undergraduate work, these projects tackle complex theoretical concepts and implementation details of distributed ledgers and predictive modeling, reflecting a capability for independent research and complex problem-solving.
